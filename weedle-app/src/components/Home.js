              Simply report an invasive species by "weedling" it and burning it off the face
              of the earth. By contributing to the mortal demise of these invasive monsters, each user is 
              rewarded points. The greater amount of points you have, the higher up on the leaderboard 
              you climb!

               and sharing observations of biodiversity across the globe.

              We compare and sort which invasive species is most impacting your area. You can view observation data, through
              Google Map API  to show you the invasive sightings in your area. This also comes into play in our point system where the 
              rarer the species in your area the more reward you get in reporting it!
